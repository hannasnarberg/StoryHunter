## Description

StoryHunter is the website that will help you find your new favourite series! On the website the user can see a list of popular series, search for series, add series to their watch list, get recommendations based on a title and if the user is feeling adventurous, they can get a randomized suggestion. The idea of StoryHunter is to make it easy for users to browse series to find their next one!
