## Description

Find your next TV obsession on Story Hunter, a web app designed for browsing series. Search, add to your watchlist, stay current with trending shows, or get personalized recommendations based on your preferences. Feeling daring? Try a randomized suggestion. This website was developed by a team of four, using a model-view-presenter architecture, and I was mainly responsible for developing the model and presenters. For the live demo, feel free to use our guest account. Email: guest@gmail.com. Password: guest1.
